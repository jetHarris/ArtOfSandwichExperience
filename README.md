# ArtOfSandwichExperience
This game was the final project for a Game Development Advanced Programming

We had to use a random game name generator and use whatever name we got
to create a game. I got the name "Art of Sandwich Experience", so I made
a sandwich assembling game. 

We created our game engines throughout the year of the post graduate course. 
All of our engines were built using C++ and OpenGL. We would code our 
engines along with the professor, so some of the code is from class. 

The most difficult thing attempted in this project was slicing a mesh.

Notes:
-this project is only meant to be run in 64 bit
