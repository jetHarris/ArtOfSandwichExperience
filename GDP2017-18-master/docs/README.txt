# GDP2017-18
Code from the GDP 2017-2018 session

This is the 'in-class' example code from Michael Feeney's classes 
in the Fanshawe College "Game Development - Advanced Programming" program
for the 2017-2018 term. Fanshawe College is in London, Ontario.

This year, we used GLFW, glad, and glm for the base code. 
The code works in Visual Studio 2015 and 2017 under Windows 7
and Windows 10, but it hasn't been tested in anything else.

If you are looking for the in-class PlayStation 4 examples, 
they aren't here, and aren't posted in a public github repo.  
(Posting would violate the agrement with Sony)

Before you comment, PLEASE keep in mind that: 
- We started with this: http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/quick.html
- ** It was coded, interactively, as part of lecturing (i.e. 
  trying to explain things) in front of the class, during 
  the 10-ish class hours/week.**
  (So ALL of this represents, at most, 300 hours of work. Total.)
- You can watch it being made here: https://www.twitch.tv/lordmichaelmort
- This code is for **educational** purposes, and this repo
  is just Where The Code is/was during the 2017-18 term. 
  (putting it here was easiest for the students and I)
  (so I'm not really interested in 'maintaining this project', 
   as it really isn't a 'project' or whatever, so if I ignore
   a pull request, it's nothing personal; I just have other 
   things/projects/whatever going on)
- Virtually everything in here is (was) an attempt to explain 
  some programming/game engine concept using the most accessible 
  code possible (i.e. aim was for CLARITY of explaining the 
  concept, not making Something Technically Sexy).
- If you were not in the class that year, it may not make sense. 
- This isn't intended to be The Greatest Code Evah. So if
  you find a bug, feel free to point it out, but: I might listen, 
  but don't really care about your personal opinions about C, C++, 
  or whatever other languge/tool/OS you use or prefer. Game *engines*
  are mostly written in C (and C++), so that's what we use. 
  Also: You do you.
